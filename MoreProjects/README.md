| <img src="assets/mlforall.png" width="1500"> | In the summer of COVID-19, a few friends and I got together and made a startup which got **4th Place in the UEA I-Fund Pitch Competition**. We worked together in a team of several developers, designers, and analysts to create a social platform that allows you to upload a dataset and immediately generate machine learning models from it which you can interact with directly on our platform. I led our team meetings, laid out the architecture with React and Firebase, and connected our backend to sci-kit learn.

| <img src="assets/pictex.jpeg" height="200"> | As part of the **PyTorch Hackathon**, we created an iOS app that scans an image of handwritten text and generates a LaTeX file for it. As college students who often typeset assignments in LaTeX, this was our attempt at leveraging computer vision to do it for us. I laid out the foundation for the Convolutional Neural Net used in our model, the dataloaders, and the deployment of our model into an iOS App that I also created with SwiftUI.
