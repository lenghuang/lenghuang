## Hi, I'm `Len` Huang 👋

You might know me from finding the length of a list in `Python`. I'm currently a software engineer in New York City working at StubHub. In the past, I was a Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. Here's some of the various little things I've worked on throughout the years, hopefully you find them interesting!
