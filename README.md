## Hi, I'm `Len` Huang ðŸ‘‹

You might know me from finding the length of a list in `Python`. I'm currently a software engineer in New York City working at StubHub. In the past, I was a Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA.

We worked together in a team of several developers, designers, and analysts to create a social platform that allows you to upload a dataset and immediately generate machine learning models from it which you can interact with directly on our platform.

| <img src="MoreProjects/assets/pictex.jpeg" height="300"> | As part of the **PyTorch Hackathon**, we created an iOS app that scans an image of handwritten text and generates a LaTeX file for it. We created PicTeX by using an RCNN model to preprocess images for regions of interest and then use a classifier to identify each symbol. We used PyTorch to train our classifier and S3 buckets to integrate the object detection model functionality into an iOS app. [Repo](https://github.com/lenghuang/picTex) |
