## Hi, I'm `Len` Huang 👋

You might know me from finding the length of a list in `Python`. If you don't know me, I'm a second year computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm really passionate about creating **user-centered** applications that provide value to people's lives. Some topics I enjoy are full-stack development, serverless architectures, sports analytics, machine learning, and functional programming.
